      <h1>Warm-Up Discussion: Some Review of Kafka Concepts</h1>

      <p>Chat with a neighbor or two about these questions to review some 
         ideas about Kafka that will end up being important things in this course 
         and help each other out. There's a time on each; don't spend longer than that time. 
      </p>


      <h2>Question 1 (9 mins)</h2>

      <p>Suppose you have a new producer. Suppose, further, <font face="monospace">linger.ms</font>
         has been increased from its default to 5 minutes. 
      </p>

      <ol type="a">
         <li>You send a message and it gets partitioned to partition <i>p</i><sub>5</sub>. 
             What all happens from the moment that assignment is determined until the message
             makes it to the page cache of the broker containing <i>p</i><sub>5</sub>?
         </li>

         <li>Suppose, now, an overall total of 31.9 MB of messages has been produced by this
             producer and assigned to various partitions. No broker yet knows anything about any of
             these messages. You send a message of size 0.5 MB. Does it fail? Explain why or why
             not.
         </li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Question 2 (8 mins)</h2>


      <p>Suppose you have 5 brokers. We will concern ourselves with a partition 
         <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>.
      </p>

      <ol type="a">
         <li>Suppose replication factor for <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> is 3. Illustrate a possible 
             scenario.
         </li>

         <li>Suppose replication factor for <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> is instead 7. Illustrate a 
             possible scenario.
         </li>

        <li>Finally, regardless of anything in the previous parts, we have the following situation
            for our replicas:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>1, <i>L</i></sub> contains messages 
                <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> and the 
                last write went to this replica first
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>1, <i>F</i>0</sub> contains messages 
                <i>m</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>1, <i>F</i>1</sub> contains messages 
                <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>.
            <br>Suppose the broker containing <i>p</i><sub>1, <i>L</i></sub> fails. 
                What will happen? Explain. 
         </li>
      </ol>
